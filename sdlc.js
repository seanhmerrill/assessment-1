// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisofRequirements = "Developers analyze requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software"
const design = "Developers create designs to acheive the project result"
const implementation = "Developers code the product. They analyze the requirements to identify smaller coding tasks they can do daily to achieve the final result"
const testingandIntegration = "The development team combines automation and manual testing to check the software for bugs"
const maintain = "Developers fix bugs, resolve customer issues, and manage software changes. They'll also monitor security, user experience, and try to improve the existing software"
